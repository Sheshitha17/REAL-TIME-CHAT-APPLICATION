The task is to develop a real-time chat application using WebSockets for instant communication between users, and a front-end JavaScript framework like Vue.js or React.js to create a modern, interactive user interface. Real-time chat means that messages sent by one user appear instantly on other users' screens without needing to refresh the page.
WebSockets are used to maintain a constant, two-way connection between the client (browser) and server. This allows messages to be sent and received immediately, making it ideal for chat applications. The backend will be built using Node.js and the ws library, which provides WebSocket support. This server will handle multiple connections and broadcast messages to all connected users.
On the frontend, Vue.js or React.js will be used to create components such as the message display area, input field, and send button. The app will connect to the WebSocket server and listen for incoming messages, updating the UI in real-time.
This project demonstrates full-stack development skills and how real-time communication systems work. It helps in understanding how WebSockets operate, and how modern front-end frameworks handle dynamic data updates efficiently and cleanly.
